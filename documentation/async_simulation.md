# Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Simulation

URBAN-SIM supports both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** multi-environment simulations. These two modes differ in how environments spawned.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Synchronous Simulation

In synchronous mode, all environments are advanced **together in lock-step**. They share the **same scene layout**, including map structure, object placement, and pedestrian routes. This setting is ideal for:
- Controlled debugging
- Frame-aligned evaluation
- Consistent benchmarking across environments

```bash
python urbansim/envs/separate_envs/random_env.py --num_envs 16 --scenario_type {clean,static,dynamic}
```

### Example Scenario Types:
- `clean`: Empty environment without obstacles
- `static`: With static obstacles
- `dynamic`: With both static and dynamic (e.g., pedestrians) elements

---

## ‚ö° Asynchronous Simulation

In asynchronous mode, each environment is generated **independently**, allowing for diverse scenario layouts, object instances, appearances, etc. This is especially useful for improving robustness, or simulating real-world noise.

```bash
python urbansim/envs/separate_envs/random_env.py --num_envs 16 --scenario_type {clean,static,dynamic} --use_async
```

### Advantages:
- Enables greater variation in observation-action loops
- Closer to real-world multi-agent or multi-robot setups
- Can increase training speed under high environment counts

### üîÑ Semantic Differences: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Scenarios

In **synchronous simulation**, all environments share the **same scene layout**, obstacle placement, and map structure. This is ideal for evaluation and debugging where controlled consistency is needed.

In **asynchronous simulation**, each environment instance is procedurally varied. This allows:
- Diverse layouts and building placements
- Varying pedestrian paths and densities
- Scene-level randomness in lighting or asset combinations

This diversity helps improve the generalization and robustness of navigation policies.

> ‚úÖ Asynchronous simulation is ideal for large-scale training across diverse environments.

## üñºÔ∏è Scenario Visualizations

Different scenario types can be combined with both simulation modes. For example:

- `clean` (empty world)
- `static` (with immovable structures)
- `dynamic` (with moving pedestrians)
